Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive company, and I can
only take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, ads, social media),
I built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and
all of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of
puzzles each year takes all of my free time for 4-5 months. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory ---</h2><p>With the toboggan login problems resolved, you set off toward the airport. While travel by toboggan might be easy, it's certainly not safe: there's <span title="It looks like the toboggan steering system even runs on Intcode! Good thing you don't have to modify it.">very minimal steering</span> and the area is covered in trees. You'll need to see which angles will take you near the fewest trees.</p>
<p>Due to the local geology, trees in this area only grow on exact integer coordinates in a grid. You make a map (your puzzle input) of the open squares (<code>.</code>) and trees (<code>#</code>) you can see. For example:</p>
<pre><code>..##.......
#...#...#..
.#....#..#.
..#.#...#.#
.#...##..#.
..#.##.....
.#.#.#....#
.#........#
#.##...#...
#...##....#
.#..#...#.#
</code></pre>
<p>These aren't the only trees, though; due to something you read about once involving arboreal genetics and biome stability, the same pattern repeats to the right many times:</p>
<pre><code><em>..##.......</em>..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  ---&gt;
<em>#...#...#..</em>#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
<em>.#....#..#.</em>.#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
<em>..#.#...#.#</em>..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
<em>.#...##..#.</em>.#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
<em>..#.##.....</em>..#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  ---&gt;
<em>.#.#.#....#</em>.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#
<em>.#........#</em>.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#
<em>#.##...#...</em>#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...
<em>#...##....#</em>#...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....#
<em>.#..#...#.#</em>.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  ---&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You start on the open square (<code>.</code>) in the top-left corner and need to reach the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map).</p>
<p>The toboggan can only follow a few specific slopes (you opted for a cheaper model that prefers rational numbers); start by <em>counting all the trees</em> you would encounter for the slope <em>right 3, down 1</em>:</p>
<p>From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is right 3 and down 1. Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map.</p>
<p>The locations you'd check in the above example are marked here with <code><em>O</em></code> where there was an open square and <code><em>X</em></code> where there was a tree:</p>
<pre><code>..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  ---&gt;
#..<em>O</em>#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
.#....<em>X</em>..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
..#.#...#<em>O</em>#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
.#...##..#..<em>X</em>...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
..#.##.......#.<em>X</em>#.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  ---&gt;
.#.#.#....#.#.#.#.<em>O</em>..#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#
.#........#.#........<em>X</em>.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#
#.##...#...#.##...#...#.<em>X</em>#...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...
#...##....##...##....##...#<em>X</em>....##...##....##...##....##...##....#
.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...<em>X</em>.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  ---&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, traversing the map using this slope would cause you to encounter <code><em>7</em></code> trees.</p>
<p>Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3 and down 1, <em>how many trees would you encounter?</em></p>
